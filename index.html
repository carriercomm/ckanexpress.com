        <h4>Proven technology</h4>
        <p>CKAN Express is powered by CKAN — the leading platform which governments around the world use to run their national data portals — including the US government for data.gov, the UK Government for data.gov.uk, the Brazilian government for dados.gov.br and dozens of others.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="icon icon-code">
        <h4>No geeks required</h4>
        <p>CKAN Express is a fully managed service. We take care of all the technology and hosting so you can focus on getting your data published rather than battling with IT. Your site is in safe hands, hosted on a resilient and scalable platform. </p>

      <div class="icon icon-lock">
        <h4>A safe home for your open data</h4>
        <p>CKAN has been developed according to best practices for building secure web applications. CKAN is used by multiple governments around the world and has been subjected to penetration testing as part of these deployments. All our plans use SSL to ensure that user logins are encrypted and can’t be intercepted.</p>

        <h4>User friendly</h4>
        <p>CKAN is easy to use with an intuitive interface — loved by publishers and end users. </p>
			</div>
      <div class="icon icon-puzzle">
        <h4>Plays well with others</h4>
        <p>CKAN provides a rich API to your data catalogue. This means that data published in your site can be automatically harvested into national catalogues like data.gov.uk massively increasing the reach of your data publishing. </p>

        <h4>Publish any type of data with visualizations of common types</h4>
        <p>You can publish your data in any format and it will be available for users to download. For common formats like CSV and Excel your users can preview and graph the data online before they download it. </p>
			</div>
      <div class="icon icon-open">
        <h4>No lock in</h4>
        <p>CKAN Express is built with open source software. This means that unlike proprietary solutions you can move your site to your own hosting or another provider at any time. Should you wish to migrate we will provide an export of all your data and the code that powers your site that can be directly imported into your new CKAN instance. There is a small charge (£350) to cover staff time for this. </p>
			</div>
      <div class="icon icon-phone">
        <h4>Encourage data reuse</h4>
        <p>CKAN provides an API to your tabular datasets which allows developers to reuse the data directly from their applications.</p>
			</div>
      <div class="icon icon-org">
        <h4>Support for your workflow</h4>
        <p>CKAN Express allows you to create organisations within your site and state which users can publish for each organisation. This allows you to decentralise publishing to staff within those organisations. </p>
